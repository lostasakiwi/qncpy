# qncpy

Quick network check using either http or tcp.            

## Requirements

- python 3.7 or above

### Use cases

- Quick sanity check that the internet has not disappeared. If I think my network or a chunk
of the internet has gone, I have a .conf file populated with a handful of sites that should b
e up e.g. my default gateway, google, my external DNS provider. Anything that would help quickly determine if there is an issue and perhaps indicate what that might be.
- Daily report. I use this for infrastructure that I know should be operational but not critical enough to get an alert on. 
  - I check server remote boards e.g. iDRACs, ilos etc to make sure these are still plugged in and available (you know they disappear from time to timeâ€¦ especially when you need them).
  - PBX, check all of the ports are operational and web-server running
  - Is my IP phone talking to the network
  - Has my printer gone offline 
  - Anything that would be really annoying to find out at the least opportune time that it is not there!

### Configuration

`qncpy.py` is the script. There is some simple error checking to make sure the `qncpy.conf` file makes sense e.g. DNS lookup, is the port number valid etc.
`qncpy.conf` is the configuration file that the script looks for in the same directory. The default file included shows some examples
There are 3 fields required separated by ::

   - Hostname or IP address
   - connection type either http or tcp
   - port(s) separated by , e.g. 80,8080

e.g.

```bash
1.1.1.1::tcp::53,80
https://cloudflare.com::http::443
https://google.com::http::443
```

### Output

The output is displayed on the console as well as writing out to a file called e.g. `qncpy_26.txt`, where 26 is the current day. It will overwrite an existing file of the same name. If used with a daily cron, this will give a rolling last month check.
